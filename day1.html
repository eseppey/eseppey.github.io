  <h1>Example Site</h1>
  <h2> What is Example Site?</h2>
  <p> This is an example of all my HTML and CSS knowledge after a day of learning.
      I just need to make some stuff so I'm writing this. Hopefully this is enough because I'm running out of ideas.
      In fact, I am so out of ideas that I will just copy-paste this a few times. <br><br>

  <h2>What else can you do!?</h2>
  <p>Well I'm glad you asked! I can also do</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lists</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Including both numbered</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>And non-numbered ones</li>
          <ul class="joke">
            <li>Wait, why is it opposite??</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>

  </ul>
<h2>Lists are cool, but what about links?</h2>
<p>I can do those too, of course. <a href="www.eseppey.github.io"> Ha-ha!</a></p>
