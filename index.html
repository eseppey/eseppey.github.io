  <h1> eSeppey's Homepage </h1>
  <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    This website currently represents all of my knowledge in
    HTML and CSS. It looks as good as I'm able to make it. Since I'm learning
    new things every day, don't expect it to look like this for too long.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below you can find all the things I do, mainly related to web development
    and programming. I'm a mere beginner, so don't expect much, but it is what it is.

  <h3> My HTML/CSS Journey </h3>
  <p>
    I'm creating a new website whenever I learn new things. I think this journal-type
    of thing could be very useful to see my progres and look back for that sweet, sweet
    nostalgia hit from time to time. In either case, while this homepage represents
    the best of my abilities, these website represent the progress I made.
